# Black-friday-sale-analysis

# Project Overview

This project focuses on the detailed exploration and analysis of the Black Friday Sales Dataset, a collection of retail transaction records. The dataset is ideal for practicing feature engineering, data preprocessing, and performing statistical analysis. offering rich insights into consumer purchasing behavior.

# Objective

The primary goals of this project are:

- Understand the structure and contents of the Black Friday dataset.
- Perform extensive data cleaning, including handling missing values and duplicate entries.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover shopping patterns and trends.
- Engineer new features and categorize transactions based on purchase amounts.
- Summarize key statistics and generate meaningful business insights.
- Visualize the relationships among customers, products, and purchasing behaviors.

# Tasks Covered

- Data inspection (shape, dimensions, missing values, data types).
- Dataset slicing, indexing, and conditional selection.
- Handling missing data through both dropping and imputing techniques.
- Generating descriptive statistics for numerical and categorical variables.
- Identifying top customers and most popular products.
- Segmenting transactions into "High Focused" and "General" categories.
- Encoding categorical variables for machine learning readiness.
- Aggregating revenue and analyzing product categories.
- Advanced querying (e.g., customers based on city, gender, purchase thresholds).

# Key Deliverables

- Cleaned and well-structured dataset.
- Insightful visualizations and data summaries.
- Business-ready conclusions for better retail decision-making.
- A reproducible Python code file for all the analysis tasks.

# Dataset Details

- Rows: 550,069
- Columns: 12
- Problem Statement: Predict and analyze purchase behaviors based on user and product features.
